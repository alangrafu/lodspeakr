Manual Installation
--------------------

* Download the source or clone the repository from http://github.com/alangrafu/lodspeakr

* Edit settings.default.inc.php and change the following values:
** $conf['endpoint']['host']     Point to the SPARQL endpoint with your data
** $conf['basedir']              The base URL in which slopds will be locations (e.g., http://example.org, http://example.com/data)
** $conf['metaendpoint']['host'] Similar to the endpoint, but this will store the metadata related to the pages about the resources in your data
** If you want, you can add more namespaces as  $conf['ns']['myns']    = 'http://namespacesite.com/'

* mv settings.default.inc.php settings.inc.php

* chmod 777 cache

That's it. You should be able to serve tour data in RDF/XML, Turtle, Ntriples and RDFa.
